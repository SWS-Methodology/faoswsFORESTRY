Appendix Describe all code lists, reference tables (datatables) and data sets. Why to use the SWS The Statistical Working System (SWS) is a corporate system that supports data collection, processing and validation, metadata management, and quality assessment of FAO’s main statistical domains in line with the Generic Statistical Business Process Model. It has a dual nature – both technological and statistical – and for this reason, is developed by two different teams (the IT Division [CIO] and the Statistics Division [ESS]). The SWS provides an end-to-end solution for inputting and storing raw data, performing automated statistical processes (e.g. imputation, validation, etc.), and producing data that are ready for dissemination. Moreover, the reasons why you should use the SWS are: The SWS improves data quality by centralizing and standardizing the maintenance of data, classification systems, methodologies, and standards. The SWS is cost-efficient in terms of statistical development and functionalities: Technical units can adopt methods and even pieces of codes developed for other units: documentation and scripts are open; Users have direct access to some common datasets, thus removing duplication of efforts; New functionalities reflect the requirements of all users and are available to all users, with economies of scale on IT development. Users have full control of the quality of the data they are producing: Increased use of advanced and semi-automated statistical methods reduce the need for manual interventions and ensure that results are reproducible; Establishment and use of a ‘basic’ set of quality and performance indicators for processes and outputs based on the FAO Statistical Quality Assurance Framework (SQAF); Assessment and publication of quality indicators on a regular basis. The SWS ensures corporate data consistency through the adoption of statistical standards. In particular, the SWS Facilitates the adoption of corporate standard classifications, metadata and code lists through seamless integration with the corporate Reference Data Management system; Reduces the fragmentation and duplication of sources (e.g. population data), thus reducing inconsistencies across technical units; Provides flexible tools for a wide range of data collection processes including web data scraping and questionnaire management, thus reducing the duplication of data collection efforts. The SWS preserves institutional knowledge by recording the history of data revisions, automating methodology and calculations, and providing end users with unambiguous instructions to follow. Go to the Statistical Working System website (restricted access). Migration actors Any migration into the SWS requires the interaction between at least three actors: The technical unit interested in automating either some or all its analytical processes in the SWS. The technical unit can be treated as client demanding services from the counterparts responsible for the implementation of its data and statistical assets in the SWS. Therefore, a successful Forestry Production and Trade migration depends on the coordination between the technical division and other parts. In the Forestry Production and Trade migration to SWS the technical unit is represented by: Arvydas Lebedys Forestry Officer (FOA) Roberto Bargigia Statistical Assistant (FOA) Marcella Canero Statistical Assistant (FOA) Iana Arkhipova Statistician (FOA) The ESS - Methodological Innovation Team (ESS - SWS) responsible for the implementation and documentation of the required statistical processes. From the ESS - SWS team the focal points are: Bruno Caetano Vidigal Statistician (ESS) Francy Lisboa Agronomist/Statistician (ESS) Luís G. Silva e Silva Statistician (ESS) Carola Fabi Senior Statistician (ESS) The CIO - SWS the primary backend and frontend maintainer of the SWS and responsible for the implementation and documentation of non-statistical processes (IT infrastructure). The CIO - SWS team have as interlocutors: Enrico Anello Full Stack Developer (CIO) Matteo Terrinoni Lead Front End Developer (CIO) John Rowell Information Technology Officer (CIO) "],
["ForestryFramework.html", "Chapter 1 Forestry Production and Trade - Framework 1.1 Data Collection 1.2 Entering Data 1.3 Aggregates 1.4 Validation/Dissemination", " Chapter 1 Forestry Production and Trade - Framework This book focuses on the migration of the Forestry Production and Trade statistical processes to SWS. Therefore, it is important to provide an overview of the statistical value chain carried by FOA. The next sections summarize the Forestry Production and Trade data collection and information management methodology. Figure 1.1: Workflow of the Forestry Production and Trade process 1.1 Data Collection The Forestry Production and Trade data collection relies on the Joint Forestry Sector Questionnaire distpatch. The dispatch of the same harmonized questionnaire is carried out by FAO and its international partners: Eurostat : The statistical office of the European Union (responsible for EU and EFTA countries) ITTO : The International Tropical Timber Organization (responsible for all tropical timber producer countries and consumer countries in Asia and Oceania) UNECE : The United Nations Economic Comission for Europe (responsible for non-EU countries in Europe, Central Asia and Northern America) FAO sends questionnaires to countries in May/June and the deadline for the first response is September 1st. The partners send out questionnaires between April and June and FAO receives validated data from partners from July to November. 1.2 Entering Data Both data coming from either questionnaires or FAO partners are entered in the SWS by the user through csv files. Once the data are in the system, a validation procedure takes place. 1.3 Aggregates Once the data has been validated, the user is ready to go ahead and generate the aggregates through the module faoswsForestryAggregation. More information about this module is found in the chapter 5. 1.4 Validation/Dissemination After calculating the aggregates, three modules are ran in order to perform other kinds of validation (annual changes, negative consumption and unit value). More information about these modules are found in the chapters 6, 7 and 8. After the step validation, the FOA unit responsible for Forestry Production and Trade can disseminate the data in the FAOSTAT. "],
["ForestryUNECEITTOInputData.html", "Chapter 2 The Forestry_UNECE_ITTO_Input_Data module 2.1 Steps 2.2 Running the module", " Chapter 2 The Forestry_UNECE_ITTO_Input_Data module The Forestry_UNECE_ITTO_Input_Data module is essentially a data harvester. It pulls the raw data provided by partners from the datatable UNECE/ITTO Input Data and coverts it into a SWS-compliant dataset format. The module deals not only with the data itself, but also with the metadata available. It is important to note that, while the process described above is automated, the user must upload the .csv file format to the datatable UNECE/ITTO Input Data. Figure 2.1: Workflow of the Forestry_UNECE_ITTO_Input_Data module 2.1 Steps The module is straightforward as it checks if the data for countries/items coming from the input data does exist in the forestry_prod_trade dataset. To do so, the module checks the code lists for countries (geographicAreaM49) and for items (measuredItemForestry) as they are used to build the forestry data set. In case there is any inconsistency, a message will pop up in the system warning the user and a input data validation will be needed. 2.2 Running the module Log in the SWS; Click on New Query; Select Forestry domain and forestry_prod_trade dataset; Select whatever geographicAreaM49, measuredElement, measuredItemForestry and timePointYears. After that, run the query; Figure 2.2: Steps 1 to 4 Click on Run plugin on the top-right; Select the Forestry_UNECE_ITTO_Input_Data module, choose the parameters (Start and End year) and click on Run plugin; Figure 2.3: Select the Forestry_UNECE_ITTO_Input_Data plugin and run it 7.

It plays an important role in detecting inconsistency, if any, as this is the precedent step before the aggregates. Figure 3.1: Workflow of the Forestry_Validation_Input module 3.1 Steps This plugin will be ran over the dataset forestry_prod_trade doing the following checks: check and identify broken series (e.g. the country A has data for item I and element E for 1961, 1962, 1963, 1965. In this example, there’s a break in the series in 1964); check and identify combinations that cannot exist (based on the the datatable Forestry Product Aggregation Elements); spot countries that should not have data in a given year; check inconsistency in the trade data (e.g. if both trade value and quantity exist). An email will be sent to the user with the four outputs above. This plugin should be tested before the aggregation step. If there’s no problem in the dataset, the data is ready to be used as an input to calculate the aggregates. 3.2 Running the module Log in the SWS; Click on New Query; Select Forestry domain and forestry_prod_trade dataset; Select whatever geographicAreaM49, measuredElement, measuredItemForestry and timePointYears.

["ForestryCarryForward.html", "Chapter 4 The faoswsForestryCarryForward module 4.1 Steps 4.2 Running the module", " Chapter 4 The faoswsForestryCarryForward module A step right before calculating the aggregates is to Carry-Forward the input data (forestry_prod_trade dataset). This step is paramount while the new data coming from partners and questionnaires do not arrive. Thus, the whole process does not get stuck and the aggregates are calculated. Figure 4.1: Workflow of the faoswsForestryCarryForward module 4.1 Steps The module is straightforward as it just imputes data by the carry-forward method. The module is smart enough to inform the user in case there is already data for the chosen year or if the year in question is too far from the last available year with data. 4.2 Running the module Log in the SWS; Click on New Query; Select Forestry domain and forestry_prod_trade dataset; Select whatever geographicAreaM49, measuredElement, measuredItemForestry and timePointYears.

["faoswsForestryAggregation.html", "Chapter 5 The faoswsForestryAggregation module 5.1 Steps 5.2 Running the module", " Chapter 5 The faoswsForestryAggregation module The module faoswsForestryAggregation comprehend the main step in the Forestry Production and Trade process as it calculates the aggregates by region and item that will be disseminated through FAOSTAT. Figure 5.1: Workflow of the faoswsForestryAggregation module 5.1 Steps The module can be basically split into four parts as below. 5.1.1 Read in the data The module uses the forestry_prod_trade dataset as input. According to the technical unit, they will be constantly changing this dataset throughout the data cycle, specially when new data come in or the officers decide to make changes based on their domain knowledge. 5.1.2 Get regional aggregation After reading in the input dataset, the module geographically aggregates the primary commodities based on FAOSTAT - UNSD M49 mapping. Please, for a full representation of this table consult either the Appendix A.11 or this link. 5.1.3 Get Forestry commodity aggregation Once a data set with regional aggregate is ready, the module moves to producing commodity aggregations at the national and regional levels. Since there is an interplay between commodity groups, the module carries the aggregation in tandem, with four commodity groups being aggregated first and then rest of aggregates. Table 5.1: First commodity groups to be calculated by the faoswsForestryAggregation module CommodityGroup CommodityGroupName CommodityCode CommodityName 1656 Chemical wood pulp 1660 Chemical wood pulp, sulphite, unbleached 1656 Chemical wood pulp 1661 Chemical wood pulp, sulphite, bleached 1656 Chemical wood pulp 1662 Chemical wood pulp, sulphate, unbleached 1656 Chemical wood pulp 1663 Chemical wood pulp, sulphate, bleached 1656 Chemical wood pulp 1686 Chemical wood pulp, sulphite 1674 Printing and writing papers 1612 Printing and writing papers, uncoated, wood containing 1674 Printing and writing papers 1615 Printing and writing papers, uncoated, wood free 1674 Printing and writing papers 1616 Printing and writing papers, coated 1675 Other paper and paperboard 1676 Household and sanitary papers 1675 Other paper and paperboard 1681 Wrapping and packaging paper and paperboard 1675 Other paper and paperboard 1683 Other paper and paperboard n.e.s. 1675 Other paper and paperboard 1617 Case materials 1675 Other paper and paperboard 1618 Cartonboard 1675 Other paper and paperboard 1621 Wrapping papers 1675 Other paper and paperboard 1622 Other papers mainly for packaging 5.1.4 Get Unit values Once the import and export figures are calculated for values and quantity, the unit price, which is the quotient between values and quantity, can be easily calculated for both primary and group commodities at the national and regional levels. 5.1.5 Get back the original flags With unit values already in the data sets (national and regional), the last step is to recovery the flags from the original input. Data records added during the processing come either from geographic or commodity aggregation. Therefore, these records have “E” (Aggregation) as flagObservationStatus and “s” (summation) as flagMethod. 5.1.6 Convert FAOSTAT regions to SWS regions The processed regional data set uses FAOSTAT codes for regions. To be able to save the results in the SWS, regions must be converted to SWS regional codes compatible with the geographicAreaM49 in the forestry_prod_trade_agg dataset. For this, the module uses the following function. 5.1.7 Binding national and regional data Binding national and regional data sets. 5.1.8 Compare before and after aggregations As a validation tool, the faoswsForestryAggregation module also needs to return what has changed from the input dataset. The module flags values where the absolute difference between the input dataset and the aggregate dataset is higher than 0.1. 5.1.9 Save data in the SWS Share Drive and database The data with primary and grouped commodities at the national and regional levels can be accessed by the user as a csv file in the SWS shared drive. The full data is saved in the folder ForestryProdAndTrade -&gt; output -&gt; faoswsForestryAggregation -&gt; results, whereas the comparison csv file is saved in the folder ForestryProdAndTrade -&gt; output -&gt; faoswsForestryAggregation -&gt; comparisons. Every time the module runs these files are updated. In the SWS - database, the data is found in the dataset forestry_prod_trade_agg. 5.2 Running the module Log in the SWS; Click on New Query; Select Forestry domain and forestry_prod_trade_agg dataset; Select whatever geographicAreaM49, measuredElement, measuredItemForestry and timePointYears.

Data tables are typically used as auxiliary data to help R modules to achieve their goals. The statistical domains in SWS, through code/reference lists, define the dimensions of the datasets. Therefore, datasets are primarily used to store code list - referenced values as either input and output in the SWS. A.1 Code lists Code lists, also called reference lists in SWS parlance, are the dimensions making up the data sets that are designed by the user to store analytical results from SWS modules. The dimensions are statistical-domain-specific and are defined by the technical unit to reflect its needs regarding data collection, processing, and dissemination while meeting FAO standards. Each data set dimension has a set of codes and their associated descriptions. Thus, code lists serve to the purpose of standardization, visualization, and metadata by associating standardized codes to standardized names in the SWS data set outputs. A typical SWS compliant data set has, therefore, the following dimensions/reference lists: Geographic area. Representing a spatial scale the information is measured at. For example, countries, territories, regional aggregates, regional special groups aggregates, global aggregates. In SWS, the geographic area dimension used by Forestry Production and Trade data sets is named geographicAreaM49. Items. Those one wants to take a measurement from. For example, commodities, commodity groups, land use types, species, etc. Typical item dimension names are measuredItemCPC, *measuredItemHS, measuredItem. In SWS, the item dimension used by Forestry Production and Trade data sets is named measuredItemForestry. Table A.1: Forestry commodity codes in the measuredItemForestry code list.

Often representing a measurement that can be taken across different items. For example, area, production, share. In SWS, the element dimension/code list used by Forestry Production and Trade is measuredElement. Time (the time unit the data is displayed for: year, months, etc). In SWS, the time dimension used by Forestry Production and Trade data sets is named timePointYears. Flag (A standardized label indicating origin and/or nature of a number in the data set, e.g. (Official number)). In SWS, the flag dimension used by Forestry Production and Trade data sets is named flagObservationStatus. Please check the OCS statistical standards and the flags document to understand the flagObservationStatus rational and obtain the description of flags. Table A.2: Observation Status Flags Annotations Flag Description Annotation &lt;blank&gt; Official figure Observation reported to FAO by official statistical government agencies. B Time series break Break observations are characterized as such whendifferent content exist or a different methodology has beenapplied to this observation as compared with the preceding one (the one given for the previous period). E Estimated value Observation obtained through an estimation methodology (e.g. to produce back-casts) or based on the use of a limited amount of data or ad hoc sampling and through additional calculations (e.g. to produce a value at an early stage of the production stage while not all data are available). It may also be used in case of experimental data (e.g. in the context of a pilot ahead of a full scale production process) or in case of data of (anticipated/assessed) low quality. If needed, additional (uncoded) information can be provided through (free text) “comments” at the observation level or at a higher level. F Forecast value Value deemed to assess the magnitude which a quantity will assume at some future point of time (as distinct from \"“estimated value”\" which attempts to assess the magnitude of an already existent quantity). I Imputed value Observation imputed by FAO to replace or fill gaps in national data series, in line with the recommendations of the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA). O Missing value This code is to be used when no distinction is made between the reasons why data are missing. Data can be missing due to various reasons: data do not exist, are insignificant (or not collected because they are below a certain threshold), are unreliable, are not relevant for the period, or other reason not elsewhere specified. M Missing value (data cannot exist, not applicable) Used to denote empty cells resulting from the impossibility to collect a statistical value (e.g. a particular education level or type of institution may be not applicable to a given country’s education system). Q Missing value; suppressed Used when data are suppressed due to statistical confidentiality considerations. N Not significant (negligible) An observation is below the unit precision level. P Provisional value An observation is characterized as “provisional” when the source agency –while it bases its calculations on its standard production methodology –considers that the data, almost certainly, are expected to be revised. R Revised Revised official figure. S Exceptional event Exceptional events such as earthquake, massive forest fire, draught and flooding that occurred in the corresponding period that may have affected the observation or caused a missing value. T Unofficial figure Observation reported by non-official or semi-official sources. Includes semi-official figure. Includes data from trade organizations (e.g. International Grain Council, International Sugar Organization etc.). X Figure from international organizations Observations, both official and non-official, reported by governmental international organizations (e.g. UN, ILO, WB, UNESCO, Eurostat etc. specification on which international organization is provided in the metadata). - Method (A standardized label indicating method utilized to obtain a number in the data set. In SWS, the method dimension used by Forestry Production and Trade data sets is named flagMethod. Please check the OCS statistical standards and the flags document to understand the flagMethod rational and obtain the description of flags. Table A.3: Method flags Flag Description Unknown collection method b Balancing item c Copied from elsewhere in the working system e Estimate automatically generated by a statistical algorithm (short: statistical estimate) f Estimate manually derived, also on the basis of expert judgement (short: manual estimate) h Collected using automatic data harvesting i Calculated as identity (e.g. yield) n Value not collected or estimated, but can be assumed to be negligible p Collected (manually) from publications or databases q Collected via a questionnaire (e.g. APQ) s Calculated as sum (e.g. Grand Total, or High-income countries) t Carry-forward estimate u Value not known The Forestry flags were mapped out into the SWS flag system as below: Table A.4: FAOSTAT-SWS mapping for observations and methods in Forestry Production and Trade. flagFAOSTAT flagObservationStatus flagMethod F E f W X dash X X dash Q blank q Fp E t Fc E i Ft E t Figure A.1: Typical dimensions (SWS code/reference lists) composing a Forestry Production and Trade SWS - compliant input/output dataset A.2 Datatables Datatables are mainly used to store information helping R modules to output analytical results. Information in datatables can be of a number of types. For example, conversion factors, arithmetic formulas, mapping between flags, mapping between international classifications, etc. In SWS hierarchy, all data tables reside in a given statistical domain. Variable names (aka column names) in SWS Datatables are more flexible in terms of the names they can take than SWS datasets. One can find SWS Datatables naming variables as element_code, element_code_sws, element_code_faostat, etc. Likewise, columns describing countries across different data tables may have different classification systems. This flexibility in Datatables is beneficial as it allows to accommodate different auxiliary information. In the Forestry Production and Trade framework, the data tables are in the Forestry domain. Below is a list of current available and filled data tables in the Forestry domain.

Because SWS datasets contain code lists following international standards as dimensions, there is little space for variation of dimension names across SWS datasets for the sake of standardization. The datasets in the Forestry domain are: forestry_prod_trade. The working dataset migrated from the current Input System into the SWS. It is expected to be periodically manually edited by the technical unit (FOA) team. Changes made on this dataset may involve the domain-knowledge replacement of values due to arrival of new data at the end of data cycles and cell-level corrections via domain-knowledge. Most importantly, after alterations, and if FOA wants so, this data set is used as INPUT to the faoswsForestryAggregation module. Details on the use of this dataset are in the (Chapter 5. forestry_prod_trade_agg. An SWS dataset serving as output of the faoswsForestryAggregation. It receives the geographic and commodity aggregations after whatever saved change in the forestry_prod_trade data set. Details on the use of this dataset are in the (Chapter 5. "]

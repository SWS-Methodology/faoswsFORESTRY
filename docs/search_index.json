The statistical value chain on this exercise involves a series of different actors through which the data is acquired, processed, validated, and disseminated for public usage. Even though the FPT chain has been working timely for years, there is a need to standardize the processes into the corporate Statistical Working System with the promise of better management of statistical objects involved by making them findable, accessible, and re-usable. Therefore, this online document describes the main institutional actors involved in the migration as well as the FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND TRADE resources (code lists, datasets, data tables) created to support the SWS plugins (R modules) to meet technical unit requirements. Furthermore, the SWS plugins are presented in the form of chapters providing a detailed description of their workflows involving input -&gt; processing -&gt; output as well as results showing whether the modules have lived up to expectations.

["migration-actors.html", "Migration actors", " Migration actors Any migration into the SWS requires the interaction between at least three actors: The technical unit interested in automating either some or all its analytical processes in the SWS. The technical unit can be treated as client demanding services from the counterparts responsible for the implementation of its data and statistical assets in the SWS. Therefore, a successful FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND TRADE migration depends on the coordination between the technical division and other parts. In the AQUASTAT - SWS migration framework the technical unit is called AQUASTAT and is represented by: Arvydas Lebedys Forestry Officer (FOA) Roberto Bargigia Forestry clerk (FOA) The ESS - Methodological Innovation Team (ESS - SWS) responsible for the implementation and documentation of the required statistical processes. From the ESS - SWS team the focal points for AQUASTAT - SWS migration are: Francy Lisboa Agronomist/Statistician (ESSD) Luis Silva Statistician (ESSD) Carola Fabi Statistician (ESSD) The CIO - SWS the primary backend and frontend maintainer of the SWS and responsible for the implementation and documentation of non-statistical processes (IT infrastructure). The CIO - SWS team have as interlocutors: Enrico Anello Full Stack Developer (CIO) Matteo Terrinoni Full Stack Developer (CIO) John Rowell Information Technology Officer (CIO) "],

However, it is important to highlight the current statistical value chain carried by FOA to deliver timely FAOSTAT annual Forestry Production and Trade data disseminations. Data Collection FORESTRY PRODUCTION AND TRADE data collection relies on FAO official questionnaires and COMTRADE; Operationnalty, the FAO-FOA is directly responsible for the send out of about 100 questionnairies per year, one questionnaire per country. For the rest of state members, the questionnaire sendout task is shared with international partners: - ITTO : The International Tropical Timber Organization - Eurostat : European Statistics - UNECE : The United Nations Economic Comission for Europe As of January of 2019, 107 countries have nominated AQUASTAT national correspondents as requested by FAO Land and Water Division between April-May 2018; Alternate correspondents from different agencies are also used to improve the data collection; The FAO Office of the Chief Statistician (OCS) has endorsed the annual Water and Agriculture questionnaire; AQUASTAT sends out the questionnaire in the first semester of each year.
